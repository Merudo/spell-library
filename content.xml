You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&apos;t obliged to do so.

A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.&quot;, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&apos;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.

Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.&quot;, &quot;After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

The wall doesn&apos;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.&quot;, &quot;If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.&quot;, &quot;The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM&apos;s discretion.&quot;, &quot;If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&apos;t be dispelled.

For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&apos;s life drain attack.&quot;, &quot;You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent&apos;s successful save, a foe&apos;s critical hit, or a friend&apos;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.&quot;]}, &quot;You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&apos;s current owner.&quot;, &quot;The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10|necrotic|na} necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&apos;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&apos;t 3 or lower already, for {@dice 2d4|days} days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
